Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  -Client:
      -DriverPass (Founded by Liam, with IT support from Ian).
  -System The Client Wanted Designed:
      -DriverPass needs a web-based system that allows customers to schedule and manage driving lessons online, access online training materials and practice tests, track progress on tests and lessons and receive notifications on DMV policy updates. 

What did you do particularly well? If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  -Honestly This course was a little challenging so I feel as though I didnt complete anything as good as it should have been completed. Those Lucid charts kill me because it takes me 1 hour plus to put a simple chart together. All Lucid charts completed I would like to revise them to make it more easier to understand. Follwing guided videos will definitely help with this. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  -By analyzing the clients requirements I was able to incorporate them into a structured design. This helped meet their needs by putting together what the system should do, and by linking the user roles to their requested permissions. This ensures DriverPass can effectively manage online learning, in-car training, and appointment scheduling.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  -I approach software design by first putting together user requirements to ensure the system meets their needs. I use techniques like UML diagrams which includes use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams) that help show system functionality.
